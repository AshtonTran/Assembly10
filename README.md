# Assembly10

Write an assembly language program that will rotate right the light bar on a timer 2 based interrupt.  Set delay to 250 ms between led’s turning off.   Output your value to the light bar connected to portc.  In the end, all led’s should be on but the one that is being rotated thru.  Use the post-scalar for timer 2 using the first letter of your last name as below:

A-G    1:8 Post scaled Value
H-P     1:4 Post scaled Value 	 
Q-Z     1:2 Post scaled Value
